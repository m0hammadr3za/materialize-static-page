# Materialize static page

[Live Demo](https://materialize-static-page.vercel.app) â€¢ This is a single page HTML web application. I used materialize for styling. Materialize was one of the first styling libraries I worked with and I quite liked the development experience. I also like the design especially because this was one of the first projects I did.
